	<h3>
	  <a name="memory-q1"></a>
	  Q: How much memory should I expect to give a Worker node?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  The answer to this question will depend on the size of the
	  data sets you are working with and the nature of the queries
	  you are running, but Facebook typically runs Presto with a
	  16 GB
	  heap.

	<h2><a name="compatibility"></a>Compatibility and Support</h2>

	<h3>
	  Q: Does Presto work with Hadoop 2.2.0? Does Presto work with
	  Amazon's Elastic MapReduce? Does Presto with with
	  Hortonworks Sandbox?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  At this time, no.  The Presto team has using the client
	  version "2.0.0-cdh4.3.0" which is known to work with
	  Cloudera's CDH4 distribution.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Presto is not compatibile with Hadoop 2.2.0 or distributions
	  such as Hortonworks Sandbox which are built on Hadoop
	  2.2.0. Users who are interested in using Presto with
	  unsupported Hadoop distributions are encouraged to report
	  errors and contribute to the Presto open source project.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Q: Does Presto connect to HBase?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  Not yet. A high-performance HBase connector is currently in
	  the works.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Q: Does Presto connect to MongoDB? 
	  Does Presto connect to Cassandra?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  No one has developed a MongoDB or Cassandra connector yet.
	  If you are interested in building a connector for either of
	  these data sources, please take a look at this
	  at <a href="https://github.com/facebook/presto/pull/846">simple
	  example connector</a> as a starting point.
	</p>

	<p></p>

	<h3>
	  Q: Does Presto connect to MySQL?
	  Does Presto connect to Postgresql?
	  Does Presto connect to Oracle?
        </h3>
	
	<p>
	  Using Presto to query relational databases has been a
	  popular request, and the Presto team expects this feature to
	  be integrated into a future release, but there is currently
	  no high-performance implementation available. For more
	  information, please see the following branch
	  for <a href="https://github.com/dain/presto/tree/jdbc-plugin">an
	  experimental, unreleased JDBC plugin</a>.
	</p>


        <h2><a name="errors"></a>Common Presto Errors</h2>

	<h3>
	  Q: I get a "Failed on local exception: java.io.IOException:
	  Response is null."  exception in Presto Server if I run a
	  select query?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  Even though Hadoop and Hive may be working without any
	  issues, Presto may not be compatible with the version of
	  Hadoop you are using.  Presto has been designed to work with
	  CDH4 (specific version is Cloudera Hadoop version
	  2.0.0-cdh4.3.0), and if you are running Presto with a
	  version of Hadoop not compatible with this version you may
	  experience this "Respose is null" error message.
	</p>

	<p>
	  See the
	  related <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/presto-users/lVLvMGP1sKE">Google
	  Group</a> thread as well as several questions on
	  Stackoverflow.
	</p>

	<h3>Q: Why is Hadoop failing with a "InvalidProtocolBufferException: Message missing required fields" exception message?</h3>

	<p>
	  You are attempting to use a distribution of Hadoop that is
	  not currently supported by Presto.  This error message will
	  occur if you attempt to query a Hadoop 2.2.0 distribution or
	  a Hortonworks Sandbox distribution of Hadoop.
	</p>

	<h3>Q: Why is Presto telling me that it "Cannot connect to
	discovery server for refresh"</h3>

	<p>
	  Answer from David Phillips
	  on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19867489/presto-server-on-aws-cannot-connect-to-discovery-server">this
	  Stackoverflow question</a>: "I was wondering if someone
	  would notice this in the logs :) It's actually not a
	  problem. The error appears because the discovery client
	  starts before the discovery server is ready. You'll see
	  "succeeded for refresh" shortly after in the logs which
	  shows that it's working. We will fix the log message
	  eventually but it's purely a cosmetic issue."
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Q: When I try to query data in Presto, I'm getting a
	  OutOfMemoryError that suggests I'm running out of heap
	  space. Why?
	</h3>

	<p>
	  The amount of heap required by a worker node will vary
	  depending on the size of the dataset you are querying and
	  the nature of the SQL queries you are running.  Facebook
	  usually runs worker nodes with a 16 GB heap.  Please see the
	  answer to <a href="#memory-q1">a previous question about
	  heap size</a>.

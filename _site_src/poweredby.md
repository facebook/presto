These companies are using Presto at scale, and helping to contribute to its Open Source repo. This isn't a complete list, so if you'd like to, [please add your company.](https://github.com/facebook/presto/edit/gh-pages/poweredby.html) 

### Airbnb

*"[Presto is] integral to our company’s data infrastructure."*  
*"The biggest benefit to adding Presto to our infrastructure stack, though, is that we don’t have to add additional complexity to allow “interactive” querying."*

### Cogo Labs

*"Using Presto means that even as the amount of data we work with grows ever exponentially larger, our Analysts can continue to leverage their existing SQL skills to perform complicated analyses, quickly surfacing valuable information within that data."*

### Dropbox

*"We're really excited about Presto. We're planning on using it to quickly gain insight about the different ways our users use Dropbox, as well as diagnosing problems they encounter along the way. In our tests so far it's been rock solid and extremely fast when applied to some of our most important ad hoc use cases."* - Fred Wulff, Software Engineer, Dropbox

### Facebook

Facebook uses Presto for interactive queries against several internal data stores, including their 300PB data warehouse. Over 1,000 Facebook employees use Presto daily to run more than 30,000 queries that in total scan over a petabyte each per day.

### JD.com

Chinese e-commerce company JD.com has adopted Presto and is using it for internal reporting and real-time big data processing for its customers. The company has collaborated with us to translate the Presto website into Chinese so that it's accessible to a large number of users and developers.

### Kanmu

A Japanese startup in the financial services industry that provides card-based offers and uses Amazon EMR with Presto.

*"Kanmu migrated from Hive to using Presto on Amazon EMR because of Presto’s ability to run exploratory and iterative analytics at interactive speed, good performance with Amazon S3, and scalability to query large data sets."*

### NASDAQ

[NASDAQ recently discussed](http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/bdt314-a-big-data-analytics-app-on-amazon-emr-amazon-redshift) their Presto usage on Amazon EMR at re:Invent Talk.

### Netflix

*"Presto was already running in production at Facebook. We did some performance benchmarking and stress testing and we were impressed. We also looked under the hood and saw well designed and documented Java code. We were convinced!"*

### OpenSpan

*"OpenSpan chose Presto because of its SQL interface and ability to query data in real-time directly from Amazon S3; it allowed them to quickly explore vast amounts of data and rapidly iterate on upcoming data products. "*
